    There are more than 5.7 million Canadians living with diagnosed diabetes.
    Now more than ever, it is crucial that we remain informed about diabetes treatment 
    and research.

    <h2>What is diabetes?</h2>
    Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects the way
    the body breaks down food into energy.
    
     Those living with diabetes either do not create enough insulin
     or can’t use it effectively during the digestion process. 
     When the body has too little insulin or cells are not responding to insulin,
     blood sugar stays in the bloodstream, rather than being converted into energy. 
     High blood sugar levels can cause serious health issues, including vision loss,
     heart disease, and kidney disease.
    
   <div>The three main types of diabetes are
    Type 1, Type 2, and Gestational diabetes.
    There is no known way to prevent Type 1 diabetes, 
    but Type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed.</div> 
    
    <div class = "signs"><h2>Signs of diabetes</h2></div>
    According to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 
    symptoms of diabetes may include:
    
    <div class ="symptoms">
      <ul>
     <li>Frequent urination </li>
     <li>Dehydration / constant thirst</li>
     <li>Unintended weight loss</li>
     <li>High levels of hunger</li>
     <li>Blurred vision</li>
     <li>Tingling or numbness in hands or feet</li>
     <li>Fatigue</li>
     <li>Very dry skin</li>
     <li>Sores on the body that heal very slowly</li>
      <li>Experiencing infections more than usual</li></ul>
      If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, 
      it is recommended to visit your doctor and ask about getting your blood sugar tested.

     <h2>Types of diabetes</h2>
    <h3>There are three types of diabetes:</h3> Type 1, Type 2, and Gestational diabetes. 
    <br>
    <strong>Type 1 </strong>diabetes typically starts in childhood or into your young adult years, 
    though onset may occur at any age.
    <br>
    <strong>Type 2 </strong>diabetes symptoms often develop over several years, and some 
    people living with Type 2 diabetes don’t experience symptoms at all.
    <br>
    <strong>Gestational diabetes</strong> occurs during pregnancy and usually does not have any symptoms.
     Pregnant folks should be tested for gestational diabetes between 24-28 weeks of
     pregnancy to ensure changes can be made in time to protect you and your baby’s health.
    </div>
    
         
   <h2>Causes of diabetes</h2> 
    The main cause of diabetes varies depending on the type. 
    However, it is not certain how Type 1 diabetes is caused.
    
    Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that leaves the body without insulin.
     ccording to Diabetes Canada, researchers believe that genes and/or one’s environment
     may be responsible for triggering Type 1 diabetes. However, 
     more research must be done to confirm the true cause of this disease.
    
    Type 2 diabetes is caused by several factors, 
    including: obesity, a family history of Type 2 diabetes, ethnic background, 
    and other environmental factors. Those who are not physically active and 
    are considered overweight or obese are more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes.
    
    Gestational diabetes is caused by hormone changes during pregnancy. 
    In this case, the pancreas is not able to make enough insulin due to 
    these hormone changes. However, a pregnant person’s diet, genes, and exercise habits 
    may also be responsible for the onset of gestational diabetes.
    
     
    
      
     
    
   <h2> The future of diabetes </h2>
    Researchers from the University of British Columbia (UBC) and 
    Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) are currently conducting research 
    and clinical trials for one of the world’s first genetically engineered cell replacement
    therapies for Type 1 diabetes, having received $1 million from Canada’s 
    Stem Cell Network.
    
    “This has the potential to transform the management of Type 1 diabetes, 
    hopefully eliminating the need for daily insulin injections and overcoming
    the drawbacks of previous cell replacement therapies,”
    says Dr. David Thompson, a clinical assistant professor of endocrinology at UBC and 
    director of VCH’s Vancouver General Hospital Diabetes Centre who is leading the study.
    “I am very grateful to the Stem Cell Network for supporting this important work.”
    
    Researchers and healthcare workers at VGH & UBC Hospitals are able to conduct
    transformative diabetes research through generous donations to the VGH & UBC Hospital 
    Foundation. Please consider donating today and contributing to the search for
    a diabetes cure.
     

    <h2>Caring for diabetes</h2>
    While doctors are hard at work searching for a cure for diabetes, 
    there are steps that those living with Type 2 diabetes can take to manage symptoms,
     including losing weight, eating a balanced diet, and engaging in regular
      physical activity.
    
    Those at risk for diabetes should have their blood sugar tested regularly 
    in order to prevent or delay symptoms in the early stages.
    
         
    <h2>How loved ones can help</h2>
    Discovering that a loved one is living with diabetes can be worrisome,
     but you should know that there are plenty of things you can do to help a 
     loved one manage their diabetes.
    
    If you are seeking to help someone living with diabetes, 
    you may want to speak to a healthcare professional to better understand the 
    condition and what you can do to help. Encouraging regular physical
     activity and healthy meals with your loved one can help tremendously.
