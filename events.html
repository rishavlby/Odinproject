    <h3>Everyone loves a good party</h3> â€“ especially a party with a 
    cause. Whether it is a gala, golf tournament or walk,
     our donors can feel good knowing they are helping our
      hospitals and health care centres provide the very 
      best care to patients from all over our province.
    Each year, hundreds of caring individuals and groups 
    raise money for VGH & UBC Hospital Foundation in their 
    own creative way by hosting an independent community event.</p>
